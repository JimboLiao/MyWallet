# MyWallet

## Description
### Purpose
現今，大部分的人還未接觸到Web3的服務，而錢包作為進入Web3世界的入口是相當重要的服務，但也是讓許多使用者望之卻步的門檻。這個專案的目的是實踐一個智能合約錢包，提供多種功能讓使用者可以更加方便且安全的徜徉在Web3的世界裡。

Currently, the majority of people have not yet been exposed to Web3 services, and wallets serve as crucial gateways to enter the Web3 world. However, wallets also pose a significant barrier for many users. The goal of this project is to develop a smart contract wallet that offers various features, allowing users to navigate the Web3 world conveniently and securely.

### Why smart contract wallet
A smart contract wallet can customize many features which are not supported by an externally-owned account(EOA).

For example:
- Multisig authorization
- Account freezing
- Account recovery
- Set transaction limits
- Create whitelists
